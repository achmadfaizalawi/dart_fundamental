# Dart Fundamental

The "Dart Fundamental" project is the result of my learning journey to understand the Dart programming language. This resource is designed to help beginners get started with Dart programming and to deepen their understanding of this language.

## Description

Dart is a powerful and versatile programming language used to develop various types of applications, from mobile apps to web applications. The "Dart Fundamental" project covers the fundamental concepts in the Dart language, including basic syntax, data types, conditionals, loops, methods, lists, maps, and object-oriented programming.

## Installation

Before you can start using this project, make sure you have installed the Dart SDK. If you haven't installed the Dart SDK yet, you can download it from [Dart's Official Website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

After installing the Dart SDK, you can follow the steps below to download and run the project:

1. Clone this project:

   ```bash

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dart_fundamental

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pub get

## Usage

This project is equipped with code examples and learning materials designed to help beginners understand the basic concepts in the Dart programming language. In the "examples" directory, you will find various code examples that explain various programming concepts.

You can run these examples using the following commands:

1. Navigate to the "bin" directory:
   ```bash
   cd bin/namefolder

2. Run the program code:
   ```bash
   dart namefile.dart

When you encounter difficulties running the project on your personal computer, you can use [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) online in your web browser.
